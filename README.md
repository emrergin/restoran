# Restaurant Webpage

This is my first attempt at using **Webpack** to generate a webpage.

The theme follows from "Erişte", Turkish version of noodle. "Enişte" is a similar sounding word, meaning "husband of sister (or aunt)". So the name of the imaginary restaurant roughly translates as "Noodles of Brother-In-Law".
